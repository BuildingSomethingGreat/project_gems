                              in college.  She was a senior and my Resident
                              Assistant.  I knew she was a young woman of 
                              God and I was ready to get closer to Him.  So 
                              <br>

                                       After college, I was 
                              an independent hip-hop artist, hip-hop promoter,

                                 Christian festivals, and Christian
                                  conferences.  I worked for a Christian
                                   nonprofit organization and taught in 
                                   school and after-school abstinence 
                                   programming.  I got married and became 
                                   a stay-at-home mother and homeschooler.
                                    As a homeschooler, I taught classes for
                                     homeschool co-ops and I tutored children

                              I have been educating students for 20 years and counseling individuals, families, and groups for more than 10 years. I am extremely passionate about helping others live joy filled lives.

                              I currently conduct individual and group counseling sessions, facilitate family sessions, work with couples on sex and intimacy, and implement fun therapeutic interventions including art, music, play, movement, and creative expression.

                              My credentials include a BS in Education, MS in Family & Child Studies, EdD in Leadership and Management, and an MS in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. In addition to these degrees, I also serve as a Certified Anger Management Specialist and Certified Grief Specialist.

                              As a mother of four and educator, I adore children and I am passionate about them getting the love and support they need to be amazing humans. Since the inception of the REAL GEMS program, I have been super excited about the impact that it has had on young ladies and their matriculation into womanhood. Ms. Hill has created a life-changing portal for these young women that will serve them for the rest of their lives.

                            required. I don't mind putting the work in… I 
                            have been blessed to receive Teacher of the 
                            Year awards from my district, my county, and my
                             regional area. I've also received a Founder's 
                             Day award from the state of Michigan. I was
                              selected by the DIA to be a part of their 
                              DIA Away exhibit.

                              I have accomplished some 
                              really cool things, but my goal is to help my 
                              GEMS do even greater. I started this group, 
                              because I wanted girls to have a chance to
                              achieve greater, learn to love themselves 
                              , acknowledge their self-value, gain skills to
                               self-regulate mentally and emotionally, and 
                               obtain the resources necessary to set and 
                               achieve a goal. The legacy created thus far
                                has brought tears to my eyes because my 
                                girls have grown into some of the most 
                                amazing women I have ever met and I know
                                there are more GEMS waiting to become…

                             I am a resident of Southfield, Michigan. I studied Political Science and History at the University of Detroit Mercy while working as a Provider representative at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. I'm very passionate about politics and the reform of health care, so Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan was a natural fit.  I am currently an Analyst at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan while deciding what my next career move will be. In my free time, I love reading. I have my Six Sigma Lean Green Belt and Black Belt certifications. I also like to shop for anything and volunteer for philanthropic causes such as REAL GEMS.

                              Ms. Hill and the REAL GEMS have worked to inspire young girls to be great while dealing with hard-hitting issues.  Since its inception, REAL GEMS has relentlessly provided values that are used as a stepping stone between adolescents and young adulthood.  Moreover, the guidance and support given to the organization and members by Hill is unmatched.  As a board member, I will assist in aggressively executing the goals and responsibilities of REAL GEMS.
