              <p>GEMS is an acronym for Girls Empowered to Maintain Success. REAL GEMS was created in an effort to build self-awareness, mental wellness, and character among girls at the middle school level. It is our endeavor to inspire and impact the “whole” person (mind, body, and soul) in order to better prepare them for life. GEMS will provide girls with opportunities for exposure to various cultural experiences, leadership opportunities, and tools for social-emotional health. With active participation, young ladies will improve their decision-making abilities, self-regulate, consider the outcome of actions, and become goal-oriented. This will all aid in their ability to plan, set goals, and follow them through until completion.</p>  }

              <h2>Target Audience</h2>
              <p>The target audience for GEMS is middle school students, who possess great un-accessed potential. We are interested in girls who desire to become a positive leader and have high levels of dedication, but circumstances may cause them to deter. All GEMS must be able to display self-control and respect for authority figures. We aim to provide novel opportunities, tools for mental wellness, and experiences to compensate for deficits to create a better balance within students while building pre-teens, families, and communities. We believe each girl is already a precious gem. She only needs someone to help her true beauty shine and teach her to see it for herself!!!</p>
